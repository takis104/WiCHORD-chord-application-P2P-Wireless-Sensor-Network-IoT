# WiCHORD+ Simulator

## Functionality
Simulator Application of the Chord Protocol overlay on sensor networks in Python, consisting of the following:
- Sensor Network & Sensor Node Instance Classes Definition
- Chord Network Build Operation
- Node Join/Leave Operation
- Node Lookup Query Operation
- Calculation of Lookup Query Path Length per total number of nodes on the network
- Calculation of total number of Node IDs (contacts) stored for each sensor node on the network
- Calculation of the average number of sensor nodes involved on a Join/Leave/Lookup Query resolution
