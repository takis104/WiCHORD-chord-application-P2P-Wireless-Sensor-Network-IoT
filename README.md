# WiCHORD: Chord Protocol application on a P2P LoRaWAN Wireless Sensor Network - IoT
P2P Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) System Based on the Chord Protocol from DHTs and LoRa Wireless Technology

The case study of this project is to customize the Chord Protocol on a Wireless Sensor Network environment.

This solution was proposed on a conference paper on the IEEE IISA 2022 Conference, held at Ionial University on July 18 2022, in Corfu Greece.
