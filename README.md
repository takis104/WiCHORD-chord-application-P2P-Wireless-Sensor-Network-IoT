# WiCHORD: Chord Protocol application on a P2P LoRaWAN Wireless Sensor Network - IoT
Advanced p2p Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) System Based on the Chord Protocol from DHTs and LoRa Wireless Technology

The case study of this project is to customize the Chord Protocol in a Wireless Sensor Network environment.

This solution will be proposed on a conference paper in the IEEE IISA 2022 Conference.

## Contents:
- Simulator Application of the Chord Protocol overlay on sensor networks in Python
- Chord protocol overlay for LoRaWAN Wireless Sensor Networks in Arduino C++ (or MicroPython)
  * Supported LoRa MCU Board: LILYGO TTGO T-Beam v1.1 ESP32
